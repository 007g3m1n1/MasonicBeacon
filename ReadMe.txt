This is an app shown at the Development Summit Europe 2012 Plenary demonstrating an iPhone application for routing.

The demo was developed for the iPhone using the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS 2.3.2, xCode 4.5 (with Automatic Reference Counting) and iOS 6.0. 

For more information about the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS, please visit the Resource Center. If you would like to contact the iOS Development Team to provide feedback on this or any other code sample, please email your questions to iOSDevTeam@esri.com.
